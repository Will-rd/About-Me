      <p>
        I have been working since I as 16 years old. I held just about every position you could
        think of in a restauraunt. After about 11 years or so of that I decided to change careers
        and enter the Automotive field as a technician due to my deep interest in cars. I had a fairly
        sucessful career as a mechanic but this job didnt quite fit the lifestyle I wanted to give myself
        in 2023 I entered a full stack coding bootcamp at Georgia Institute of Technology and now I
        am currently working hard on projects such as this very site youre on right now. I enjoy
        the challenges and joy this new skill brings me!
